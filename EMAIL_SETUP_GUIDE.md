# 📧 Email Setup Guide for Render Deployment

## 🚨 Problem Identified
Your private email server (`mail.privateemail.com`) **only works with VPN** and is **not accessible from Render's cloud network**. This causes email functionality to fail in production.

## ✅ Solution Options

   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Choose "Restricted Access"
   - Give it "Mail Send" permissions
   - Copy the API key (starts with `SG.`)

3. **Update your Render environment variables:**
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

4. **Set sender email:**
   - In SendGrid dashboard, go to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Add your domain `iyonicorp.com` or use `hello@iyonicorp.com`

### Option 2: Gmail App Password 📧

## 🚀 Current System Features

Your Fashion Store now has **intelligent email routing**:

### Local Development (with VPN):

- ✅ Sends from `hello@iyonicorp.com`
- ✅ Works perfectly on your laptop

### Production/Render Deployment:

  2. SendGrid (if API key provided)
  3. Gmail (if credentials provided)
- ✅ Continues signup process even if email fails
- ✅ Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 📋 Environment Variables for Render

Set these in your Render dashboard:

```bash
# Your existing variables
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://iyonicbots:7Switched@iyonicbots.yjni991.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Iyonicbots
JWT_SECRET=mySuperSecretJWTKey123!

# Private email (will be tried first, but will fail)
SMTP_USER=hello@iyonicorp.com
SMTP_PASS=@7Switched
SMTP_HOST=mail.privateemail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
ADMIN_EMAIL=hello@iyonicorp.com

# Choose ONE of these cloud email options:

# Option A: SendGrid (Recommended)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-actual-sendgrid-api-key

# Option B: Gmail
GMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=your-16-char-app-password

# Email settings
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
EMAIL_DEBUG=true
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test locally:
```bash
node test-email-render.js
```

### Test on Render:
1. Deploy your app
2. Check Render logs for email test results
3. Try signing up a new user
4. Check if welcome email is received

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If emails still don't work on Render:

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test email service separately:**

   ```

### Common Issues:

- **"ETIMEDOUT"** = Server not accessible from cloud (expected for private email)
